<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The San Ysidro Mountains in New Mexico expose a preserved sequence of Mesozoic sedimentary formations deformed by Laramide shortening, and later tilted by Rio Grande rift extension. These rocks span the Triassic to Cretaceous periods and record a history of foreland basin subsidence, marine transgressions, and subsequent uplift, erosion, and fluvial incision. Over three days of field mapping, we recorded structural measurements and stratigraphic observations across a 2×2 km area, identifying moderately to steeply inclined beds that dip away from a central travertine-capped dome. Key formations include the Chinle Group, Todilto Formation, Entrada Sandstone, Summerville, Morrison, and Dakota Sandstone, and Mancos Shale. Each showing variable weathering and erosion consistent with extensional stress and basin uplift. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The San Ysidro anticline, situated just west of the Jemez Mountains in north-central New Mexico, exposes a spectacular, nearly continuous stack of Mesozoic strata ranging from the fluvial-lacustrine Triassic Chinle Group to the marine Cretaceous Mancos Shale (Anderson & Lucas, 1996). Because these beds occupy the hinge between the Colorado Plateau and the Rio Grande rift, they preserve both the thin-layered Sevier and thick-layered Laramide contractional rock history and the subsequent Oligocene–Recent extensional reactivation associated with rift opening and upwelling of the mantle creating uplift of the continental crust (Yonkee & Weil, 2015).</p>

<p>Earlier work shows that Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous foreland subsidence trapped fluvial and shallow-marine sediments in what is now the San Juan Basin, while later Laramide basement uplifts isolated the basin and generated significant relief (Levin, 2013, p. 307). Continued Oligocene crustal thinning along the Rio Grande rift tilted the anticline, exposing the multicolored, layered topography visible today and focusing fluvial incision that stripped much of the Jurassic–Cretaceous cover. Following Anderson & Lucas’s research, rock formations such as the Todilto Formation, dating to Middle Jurassic, and the Morrison Formation dating to early Cretaceous, preserved terrestrial and marine fossils. The oceanic fossils of bivalves, and sauropod dinosaur footprints, confirm the relative dating of these units (Anderson & Lucas, 1996). As the North American plate drifted northward following the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea, the region experienced a progressive shift in environmental settings. The transition from equatorial tropical basins to more arid continental interiors, likely resulted in the 250 my rock history contained within our training area in the San Ysidro Mountains. As the North American Cordillera shifted to extensional stress and thinning of the fluvial deposited continental crust, decompression of the lithosphere could have led to the tilted rock formations that trend east-to-west in San Ysidro, New Mexico. </p>

<p>Over three days in the San Ysidro Mountains, Daphne and I recorded structural data, examined bedding petrology, and used the local stratigraphic column to interpret the geologic history of our 2×2 km training area. Our observations support the hypothesis that the region has undergone significant weathering and erosion since the Laramide orogeny. The central anticline exposes older formations likely uplifted and later modified by fluvial processes following inundation by intracontinental seaways and deposition in shallow marine environments, as evidenced by east-to-west facies that become thinned and younger in age, such as the Morrison Formation, Burro Canyon Formation, Dakota Sandstone, and Mancos Shale. The older members such as the Chinle Formation, Entrada Sandstone, Todilto formation, and the Summerville formation dating Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic. The Todilto formation members were found to contain bivalve fossil according to Anderson & Lucas, 1996, which would imply a time period of deposition when the Seagrass Sea, an epicontinental sea split Laurasia down the middle. The massive gypsum layer of the Todilto Formation, followed by massively eroded canyons surrounds a gently sloping dome of limestone, known as travertine. Since the Gypsum surrounds the much smaller limestone formation, it's likely this gypsum layer was much larger at some point. The gypsum most likely eroded in massive fluvial and eolian erosive processes from the changing geological settings, and the limestone before that. The explanation for thinning of the continental crust from center-to-east and center-to-west could be due to normal faulting along the East and West boundaries, which would over time, be extending the anticline formation further horizontally on the plain. </p>

<h2>Data and Observations</h2>
<p>In our training area, the highest elevation of 6061ft is situated center of the map at UTM 13S 0333016 3930323. Gratefully, the location is marked with a surveyed marker by the USGS. The white, fibrous, and in some localities, “hollowed-out”, Tonque Arroyo member contains gypsum consolidates the ridgeline with sharp, cliffs overlying a valley where the other member of the Todilto Formation lies as a gentle-sloped mound of Travertine, limestone. Within the valley, bedding measurements of Entrada Sandstone were recorded up-section of the Tonque Arroyo member on the western side of the ridgeline dipping westerly. Within the central dome, observations of Chinle Formation were visibly present as highly eroded layers of dark red, orange, and gray, 1-3mm grain sized sediments, apparent as a colluvial fan.</p>

<p>Strike and dip measurements recorded from stations SD1 to SD10 during the first day revealed moderately inclined bedding throughout the central valley, dipping primarily northeast. As we followed the ridgeline toward the eastern gypsum outcrop, dips shifted more easterly, marking a transition from the Todilto Formation to the fine-grained, well-rounded Entrada Sandstone. This unit quickly gives way to the crimson-red Summerville Formation, characterized by interbedded siltstone, shale, and sandstone that appear indistinct without close inspection. Above this, folded beds of Bluff Sandstone are distinguishable by their gray hue and 1–3 mm clasts, likely due to elevated feldspar content, though mineralogical analysis was not performed. The Morrison Formation is widespread in the eastern and western basins flanking the ridgelines, where the Brushy Basin Member—composed mostly of shale with some sandstone—is heavily weathered, producing mudstone exposures surrounded by brushy vegetation (Anderson & Lucas, 1996).This basin, on both sides flanking the ridges of the Todilto Formation, has presumably been inundated in previous geologic settings and led to the fluvial incisions that eroded vast mounds of older bedrocks until water rescinded. </p>

<p>The Burro Canyon Formation, Dakota Sandstone, and Mancos Shale was not visible due to Daphne and I only venturing so far easterly. However, bedding measurements of Burro Canyon Formation, the Dakota Sandstone, and the Mancos Shale were visible South of the USGS survey marker, and they were dipping moderately inclined trending south-to-southeast, still following the anticline formation and pattern of erosion in this region, these stations were recorded from SD 27 – SD31.</p>

<p>Following the first day, the Western boundary of the map was explored, where opposed to walking central-dome of the travertine limestone to the east, Daphne and I walked North from the Parking Lot and again observed Bluff Sandstone, from SD 11 – SD 15 where dip directions were now trending westerly, a transition from the Eastern boundary of the map. </p>

<p>Observations were made of moderately inclined dip directions using Brunton compasses, and the younger Cretaceous period rocks were found to be dipping slightly steeper on averaging around 50 degrees as we walked to the western bounds of the map and continued to record measurements of the Morrison Formation characterized by layers of brittle, dark brown to black shale. As well as bedding measurements of Dakota Sandstone at SD19 – SD 21, which likely if observed on the eastern side would have followed a similar transition between the various Cretaceous formations.</p>

<p>Walking back east towards the central dome, units of the Burro Canyon, Bluff Sandstone, and Summerville formation were measured at SD 22 – 24 where they followed the up-section pattern back towards the ridgeline of the Tonque Arroyo. All units were recorded to be dipping westerly with moderately inclined dips. </p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>According to Anderson & Lucas, the Gypsum formed as an evaporite due to the regional setting of inundation and higher sea levels, where the subtle change in climate rescinded sea levels and transitioned to a more arid, humid environment leading to the precipitation of the gypsum. The bedding is hard to miss, as the white color of the outcrop will reflect sunlight back on to you, allowing one to experience the full beam, and then some of the sun. The Luciano Mesa member consists of Travertine Limestone, marking the valley as the central dome of the area and suggesting yet again, complete inundation of sediments and calcariferous lithification of limestone in a shallow, sea environment. This suggests the findings of Anderson & Lucas, with the hypothesis of the brine pool, which evaporation of water followed by precipitation of the calcium sulfate mineral gypsum. It’s possible that the Gypsum layer could have been much larger, considering the exposure of Chinle Formation sediments which lie down-section of the Todilto Formation, Entrada Sandstone preserved beneath the ridgelines, and then the Chinle Formation colluvial fans at the base of the sharp cliffs (Anderson & Lucas, 1996).</p>

<p>An angular unconformity was seen just east of the USGS marker, lying in the basin in between a smaller valley on the eastern side of Tonque Arroyo member. The gypsum lied beneath and was tilted at about 60 degrees with Summerville Members of crimson red shale, siltstone, and sandstone were interbedded on top, and Entrada Sandstone, followed by Chinle Formation underneath. It’s likely this is a result of faulting, and the result explains the exposure of older rocks being eroded away from tectonic processes.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Over three days canvasing the San Ysidro Mountains, it became clear that this formation of Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous period sedimentary rocks had been eroded and left behind landscapes with numerous formations of shale, siltstone, sandstones, limestone, and evaporates. Visible evidence noticed by different formations followed a general trend of younger Cretaceous rocks as walking from the high ridges either East, or West. This correlates with the extensional stresses which has likely been occurring within the Tertiary period of rifting and uplift during the middle Cenozoic period. Upon reviewing of literature detailing the San Juan basin and visible evidence of the angular unconformity within the Central Dome, it seems likely the area has normal faults that have exposed older rocks to be eroded. With the geological map, geological cross section, and stereo net data, it’s reasonable to conclude tectonic processes and fluvial erosion from past inundation sculpted the landscape we see today in San Ysidro.</p>
