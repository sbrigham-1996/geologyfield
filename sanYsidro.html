<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The San Ysidro Mountains in New Mexico expose a preserved sequence of Mesozoic sedimentary formations deformed by Laramide shortening, and later tilted by Rio Grande rift extension. These rocks span the Triassic to Cretaceous periods and record a history of foreland basin subsidence, marine transgressions, and subsequent uplift, erosion, and fluvial incision. Over three days of field mapping, we recorded structural measurements and stratigraphic observations across a 2×2 km area, identifying moderately to steeply inclined beds that dip away from a central travertine-capped dome. Key formations include the Chinle Group, Todilto Formation, Entrada Sandstone, Summerville, Morrison, and Dakota Sandstone, and Mancos Shale. Each showing variable weathering and erosion consistent with extensional stress and basin uplift.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The San Ysidro anticline, situated just west of the Jemez Mountains in north-central New Mexico, exposes a spectacular, nearly continuous stack of Mesozoic strata ranging from the fluvial-lacustrine Triassic Chinle Group to the marine Cretaceous Mancos Shale (Anderson &amp; Lucas, 1996). Because these beds occupy the hinge between the Colorado Plateau and the Rio Grande rift, they preserve both the thin-layered Sevier and thick-layered Laramide contractional rock history and the subsequent Oligocene–Recent extensional reactivation associated with rift opening and upwelling of the mantle creating uplift of the continental crust (Yonkee &amp; Weil, 2015).</p>

<p>Earlier work shows that Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous foreland subsidence trapped fluvial and shallow-marine sediments in what is now the San Juan Basin, while later Laramide basement uplifts isolated the basin and generated significant relief (Levin, 2013, p. 307). Continued Oligocene crustal thinning along the Rio Grande rift tilted the anticline, exposing the multicolored, layered topography visible today and focusing fluvial incision that stripped much of the Jurassic–Cretaceous cover. Following Anderson &amp; Lucas’s research, rock formations such as the Todilto Formation, dating to Middle Jurassic, and the Morrison Formation dating to early Cretaceous, preserved terrestrial and marine fossils. The oceanic fossils of bivalves, and sauropod dinosaur footprints, confirm the relative dating of these units (Anderson &amp; Lucas, 1996). As the North American plate drifted northward following the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea, the region experienced a progressive shift in environmental settings. The transition from equatorial tropical basins to more arid continental interiors, likely resulted in the 250 my rock history contained within our training area in the San Ysidro Mountains. As the North American Cordillera shifted to extensional stress and thinning of the fluvial deposited continental crust, decompression of the lithosphere could have led to the tilted rock formations that trend east-to-west in San Ysidro, New Mexico.</p>

<p>Over three days in the San Ysidro Mountains, Daphne and I recorded structural data, examined bedding petrology, and used the local stratigraphic column to interpret the geologic history of our 2×2 km training area. Our observations support the hypothesis that the region has undergone significant weathering and erosion since the Laramide orogeny...</p>

<h2>Data and Observations</h2>
<p>In our training area, the highest elevation of 6061m is situated center of the map at UTM 13S 0333016 3930323...</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>According to Anderson &amp; Lucas, the Gypsum formed as an evaporite due to the regional setting of inundation and higher sea levels...</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Over three days canvasing the San Ysidro Mountains, it became clear that this formation of Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous period sedimentary rocks had been eroded and left behind landscapes with numerous formations of shale, siltstone, sandstones, limestone, and evaporates...</p>
